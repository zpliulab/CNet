In this work, a **connected network-regularized logistic regression (CNet-RLR) model** for feature selection considering the structural connectivity in a network was proposed. Mathematically, it was a convex optimization problem constrained by inequalities reflecting network connectivity.


## CNet
<!--START_SECTION:news-->
* **CNet**: A **connected network-regularized logistic regression (CNet-RLR) model** were proposed to perform **feature selection**. 
* In both **synthetic simulation data** and real-world **UCEC cancer genomics data**, we validated the CNet-RLR model is efficient to identify the **connected-network-structured features** that can serve as **diagnostic biomarkers**.
* In the comparison study, we also proved the proposed **CNet-RLR model** results in better classification performance and feature interpretability than the **other regularized logistic regression (RLR) alternatives** and another **graph embedded feature selection model**.

## Data
<!--START_SECTION:news-->
* In the **CNet-RLR**, **NSLR_example** and **matlab_example** files, we give all **R/Matlab/Python** codes used in our work. 
* In the **Data** and **GSE63678** files, we give some necessary input/output files by the **R/Matlab/Python** codes. 
* Some of these input files only give the first few lines, but this does not affect the results of the work (**CNet-RLR**).
* In the **Supplementary file** file, we present the necessary **Additional files** contained in our work.
